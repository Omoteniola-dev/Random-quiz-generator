Thank you for viewing the random quiz generator!

The random quiz generator is a program to create different quiz files
with the questions and options randomized based on their numbers.
It is a solution to the actually problem in Automate the Boring
Stuffs by Al Sweigart.

The questions is based on the states and capitals in the united state but can be 
modified for use.

If you have any suggestions on how to make this better, you are welcomed.
